This Python project tracks the location of the International Space Station (ISS) and sends email alerts when the ISS is overhead and it's nighttime at your location. 
It uses several APIs to get the ISS position and determine whether it is visible from your coordinates.

Technologies Used
Python
ISS Position API (via Open Notify)
Sunrise-Sunset API
smtplib for sending email alerts
dotenv (for securely storing sensitive information)
